This theme supports **link posts**, made famous by John Gruber. To use, just add `link: http://url-you-want-linked` to the post's YAML front matter and you're done.

> And this is how a quote looks.

Some [link](#) can also be shown.

# notice

A notice displays information that explains nearby content. Often used to call attention to a particular detail.

When using Kramdown `{: .notice}` can be added after a sentence to assign the `.notice` to the `<p></p>` element. 

**Changes in Service:** We just updated our [privacy policy](#) here to better service our customers. We recommend reviewing the changes.
{: .notice}

**Primary Notice:** Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer nec odio. [Praesent libero](#). Sed cursus ante dapibus diam. Sed nisi. Nulla quis sem at nibh elementum imperdiet.
{: .notice--primary}

<div class="notice--primary" markdown="1">
**Primary Notice with code block:** Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer nec odio. [Praesent libero](#). Sed cursus ante dapibus diam. Sed nisi. Nulla quis sem at nibh elementum imperdiet.

```html

```
</div>

**Info Notice:** Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, [consectetur adipiscing elit](#). Integer nec odio. Praesent libero. Sed cursus ante dapibus diam. Sed nisi. Nulla quis sem at nibh elementum imperdiet.
{: .notice--info}

**Warning Notice:** Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. [Integer nec odio](#). Praesent libero. Sed cursus ante dapibus diam. Sed nisi. Nulla quis sem at nibh elementum imperdiet.
{: .notice--warning}

**Danger Notice:** Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, [consectetur adipiscing](#) elit. Integer nec odio. Praesent libero. Sed cursus ante dapibus diam. Sed nisi. Nulla quis sem at nibh elementum imperdiet.
{: .notice--danger}

**Success Notice:** Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer nec odio. Praesent libero. Sed cursus ante dapibus diam. Sed nisi. Nulla quis sem at [nibh elementum](#) imperdiet.
{: .notice--success}

Want to wrap several paragraphs or other elements in a notice? Using Liquid to capture the content and then filter it with `markdownify` is a good way to go.

```html
{% raw %}{% capture notice-2 %}
#### New Site Features

* You can now have cover images on blog pages
* Drafts will now auto-save while writing
{% endcapture %}{% endraw %}

<div class="notice">{% raw %}{{ notice-2 | markdownify }}{% endraw %}</div>
```

{% capture notice-2 %}
## New Site Features

* You can now have cover images on blog pages
* Drafts will now auto-save while writing
{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice">
  {{ notice-2 | markdownify }}
</div>

Or you could skip the capture and stick with straight HTML.

```html
<div class="notice">
  <h4>Message</h4>
  <p>A basic message.</p>
</div>
```

<div class="notice">
  <h4>Message</h4>
  <p>A basic message.</p>
</div>


# alignment

## text

### Default

This is a paragraph. It should not have any alignment of any kind. It should just flow like you would normally expect. Nothing fancy. Just straight up text, free flowing, with love. Completely neutral and not picking a side or sitting on the fence. It just is. It just freaking is. It likes where it is. It does not feel compelled to pick a side. Leave him be. It will just be better that way. Trust me.

### Left Align

This is a paragraph. It is left aligned. Because of this, it is a bit more liberal in it's views. It's favorite color is green. Left align tends to be more eco-friendly, but it provides no concrete evidence that it really is. Even though it likes share the wealth evenly, it leaves the equal distribution up to justified alignment.
{: style="text-align: left;"}

### Center Align

This is a paragraph. It is center aligned. Center is, but nature, a fence sitter. A flip flopper. It has a difficult time making up its mind. It wants to pick a side. Really, it does. It has the best intentions, but it tends to complicate matters more than help. The best you can do is try to win it over and hope for the best. I hear center align does take bribes.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

### Right Align

This is a paragraph. It is right aligned. It is a bit more conservative in it's views. It's prefers to not be told what to do or how to do it. Right align totally owns a slew of guns and loves to head to the range for some practice. Which is cool and all. I mean, it's a pretty good shot from at least four or five football fields away. Dead on. So boss.
{: style="text-align: right;"}

### Justify Align

This is a paragraph. It is justify aligned. It gets really mad when people associate it with Justin Timberlake. Typically, justified is pretty straight laced. It likes everything to be in it's place and not all cattywampus like the rest of the aligns. I am not saying that makes it better than the rest of the aligns, but it does tend to put off more of an elitist attitude.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## image


Welcome to image alignment! The best way to demonstrate the ebb and flow of the various image positioning options is to nestle them snuggly among an ocean of words. Grab a paddle and let's get started.

![image-center]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-580x300.jpg){: .align-center}

The image above happens to be **centered**.

![image-left]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-150x150.jpg){: .align-left} The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is **left aligned**.

As you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we'll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it's thing. Mission accomplished!

And now for a **massively large image**. It also has **no alignment**.

![no-alignment]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-1200x4002.jpg)

The image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.

![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-300x200.jpg){: .align-right}

And now we're going to shift things to the **right align**. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there --- Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don't care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don't let anyone else tell you differently.

In just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah --- Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.

And just when you thought we were done, we're going to do them all over again with captions!

<figure class="align-center">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-580x300.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Look at 580 x 300 getting some love.</figcaption>
</figure> 

The figure above happens to be **centered**. The caption also has a link in it, just to see if it does anything funky.

<figure style="width: 150px" class="align-left">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-150x150.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Itty-bitty caption.</figcaption>
</figure> 

The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is **left aligned**.

As you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we'll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it's thing. Mission accomplished!

And now for a **massively large image**. It also has **no alignment**.

<figure style="width: 1200px">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-1200x4002.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Massive image comment for your eyeballs.</figcaption>
</figure> 

The figure element above has an inline style of `width: 1200px` set which should break it outside of the normal content flow.

<figure style="width: 300px" class="align-right">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-300x200.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Feels good to be right all the time.</figcaption>
</figure> 

And now we're going to shift things to the **right align**. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there --- Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don't care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don't let anyone else tell you differently.

In just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah --- Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.

And that's a wrap, yo! You survived the tumultuous waters of alignment. Image alignment achievement unlocked!

## Blockquotes

Single line blockquote:

> Stay hungry. Stay foolish.

Multi line blockquote with a cite reference:

> People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.

# more images


Here are some examples of what a post with images might look like. If you want to display two or three images next to each other responsively use `figure` with the appropriate `class`. Each instance of `figure` is auto-numbered and displayed in the caption.

## Figures (for images or video)

### One Up

<figure>
	<a href="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8426/7758832526_cc8f681e48_b.jpg"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8426/7758832526_cc8f681e48_c.jpg"></a>
	<figcaption><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/80901381@N04/7758832526/" title="Morning Fog Emerging From Trees by A Guy Taking Pictures, on Flickr">Morning Fog Emerging From Trees by A Guy Taking Pictures, on Flickr</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

Vero laborum commodo occupy. Semiotics voluptate mumblecore pug. Cosby sweater ullamco quinoa ennui assumenda, sapiente occupy delectus lo-fi. Ea fashion axe Marfa cillum aliquip. Retro Bushwick keytar cliche. Before they sold out sustainable gastropub Marfa readymade, ethical Williamsburg skateboard brunch qui consectetur gentrify semiotics. Mustache cillum irony, fingerstache magna pour-over keffiyeh tousled selfies.

### Two Up

Apply the `half` class like so to display two images side by side that share the same caption.

```html
<figure class="half">
    <a href="/assets/images/image-filename-1-large.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/image-filename-1.jpg"></a>
    <a href="/assets/images/image-filename-2-large.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/image-filename-2.jpg"></a>
    <figcaption>Caption describing these two images.</figcaption>
</figure>
```

And you'll get something that looks like this:

<figure class="half">
	<a href="http://placehold.it/1200x600.JPG"><img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg"></a>
	<a href="http://placehold.it/1200x600.jpeg"><img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg"></a>
	<figcaption>Two images.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Three Up

Apply the `third` class like so to display three images side by side that share the same caption.

```html
<figure class="third">
	<img src="/images/image-filename-1.jpg">
	<img src="/images/image-filename-2.jpg">
	<img src="/images/image-filename-3.jpg">
	<figcaption>Caption describing these three images.</figcaption>
</figure>
```

And you'll get something that looks like this:

<figure class="third">
	<img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg">
	<img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg">
	<img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg">
	<figcaption>Three images.</figcaption>
</figure>


# syntax highlight

## Code Blocks in Lists

Indentation matters. Be sure the indent of the code block aligns with the first non-space character after the list item marker (e.g., `1.`). Usually this will mean indenting 3 spaces instead of 4.

1. Do step 1.
2. Now do this:
   
   ```ruby
   def print_hi(name)
     puts "Hi, #{name}"
   end
   print_hi('Tom')
   #=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
   ```
        
3. Now you can do this.


## hightlight with line os

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
// 'gulp html' -- does nothing
// 'gulp html --prod' -- minifies and gzips HTML files for production
gulp.task('html', () => {
  return gulp.src(paths.siteFolderName + paths.htmlPattern)
  }
)
{% endhighlight %}
